# Track B: performance log

Local numbers are from an 8 thread Linux box, seed 1 full data, best of 5 runs, sha256 matching the published `f86973c2...`.

| Step | Change | Run ID | T (s) | M (MB) | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The reference, unchanged | | 56.35 | 2,200 | 0 |
| 1 | Rust, queries first, index only the query terms, positional postings, parallel build and parallel queries | run-a80f93dff992 | 0.798 | 989 | 46.13 |

## Why it got faster

- Queries are read first, so the index only holds the terms some query actually uses. Every other token is one hash miss and gets skipped.
- Tokenizing is a 256 entry lookup table that does the ASCII lowercase and the separator test in one step. Bytes from 0x80 up are separators, so `Zürich` splits into `z` and `rich` for free.
- The corpus is cut into chunks on line boundaries and tokenized on all threads. Each posting is `(doc, position)`, and since chunks are in file order, concatenating them keeps every list sorted.
- BOOL is plain left to right merging of sorted doc lists (AND, OR, NOT), no precedence.
- PHRASE drives from the rarest term in the phrase and checks the other terms by binary search on `(doc, start + offset)`. The reference retokenizes every candidate document, which is where most of its time goes.
- Queries run in parallel through an atomic counter, then get written in input order.

## Next ideas

Skip positions for terms that only show up in BOOL queries, and gallop instead of linear merge when list sizes are lopsided.
